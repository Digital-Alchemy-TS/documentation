## 📚 Description

- #config/hass 
- #TServiceParams/hass

The `@digital-alchemy/hass` library provides some additional functionality that is more specialized.

## 🛡 Backup API

- #Feature/hass/Backup

You can request your Home Assistant instance start a new backup using the commands at `hass.utils.backup`. Functions will block attempts to create a new backup while one is in progress, and will keep track of when yours completes.

## 🔧 Automatic configuration for supervised

- #Feature/hass/Configuration
- #config/hass/BASE_URL 
- #config/hass/TOKEN 
- #Lifecycle/onPreInit 
- [[configuration]]

If `HASSIO_TOKEN` or `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` is detected as an environment variable (provided by Home Assistant for addons), then the library will update configuration appropriately.

## ✔️ Validate Configuration
