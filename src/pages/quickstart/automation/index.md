## 📘 Overview

Welcome to the `@digital-alchemy` [[pages/Home Automation/index|Home Automation]] quickstart project!

This project is designed to work with **Supervised** and **HA OS** based installs, where **Addons** are supported. If you used a different installation method, you will need to make tweaks to the process.

These instructions assume that [Studio Code Server Addon](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-vscode) has been installed on your setup, serving as both editor and workspace management tool.

## 🚀 Setup

> [!note]
> The below command works for:
> - Initial setup
> - Fixing a broken environment
> - Updating the `scripts` provided by quickstart repo with newer versions

Within the **Code Server Addon**:

1. Open a terminal
   - Press **Ctrl-Shift-\`** (default keybind) to open a terminal, or go through `Menu` > `Terminal` > `New Terminal`
2. Execute the command
```bash
curl -fsSL https://setup.digital-alchemy.app -o setup.sh; bash setup.sh
```
This script will:
- Install NodeJS on your system
- Pull down the [starter template](https://github.com/Digital-Alchemy-TS/automation-quickstart)
- Install all necessary dependencies
- Add the [[Addon|local code runner]] addon as a local addon

The final install step is for you to install the addon.

No sound orientation videos, for a bit of context on what things should look like when everything goes right.

> [!tldr] Tldw: Setup Process
> Speed run of the setup process, taking a break to run the code manually and in the background with the addon

## ⚒️ Workspace Management

> [!warning]
> The NodeJS environment within the Code Server addon does not survive reboots and may occasionally need to be set up again.
>

A script has been provided to restore your environment if something goes wrong.
```bash
./scripts/environment.sh
```
>
> Also accessible as a task within VSCode as part of the workspace.
> Use `Tasks: Run Task` from the command palette to access

Once your environment is set up, you can use the commands in the `package.json` to manage your workspace further.
