## üìö Description

Welcome to `@digital-alchemy/synapse`!

This project builds on the functions provided by [hass](/hass/) to provide the ability to generate entities within your Home Assistant install.

üèóÔ∏è You are able to create entities from a wide variety of domains, ranging from helpers to real world device types.
Easily update state in response to events, or use internal triggers to manage for you!

## üöÄ Setup

Synapse has 2 major components to install in order to achieve proper functionality.

1. Custom component: [synapse-extension](/synapse-extension)
2. Typescript library: [install guide](/synapse/install)

[Configuration & fine tuning guide](/synapse/configuration)

| Name | Note |

| [core](/core) | dependency |
| [hass](/hass) | dependency |
| [fastify](/fastify) | dependency |
| [automation](/automation) | downstream |

## üë©‚Äçüîß Basic Usage

Creating a new entity is easy! You can even attach to events inline with

```typescript
import { CronExpression, TServiceParams } from "@digital-alchemy/core";

export function ExampleService({ scheduler, context, synapse, logger }: TServiceParams) {
  synapse.button({
    context,
    press: () => logger.info("that tickles!"),
    name: "Press me",
  });
}
```

See the [usage guide](/synapse/usage) for more details about managing configurations and events

### ‚ôªÔ∏è State Restoration

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT** State is not actively persisted anywhere with `synapse`, there is no guarantee that restarting your application will not result in partial/full loss of state.

When your application reboots, `synapse` will attempt to map data from entity state reported by Home Assistant back to the configuration variable in order to reload properly.
If the entity reports as `unavailable` at boot, the immediate next state will be used.

### üîÑ Automatic availability reporting

As part of the application lifecycle, a "coming online" / "going offline" message is emitted to Home Assistant to help manage entity availability.
The application will also emit a regular heartbeat, which will cause the entities to automatically go offline after a short time if it goes missing
