# Digital Alchemy Starter Repo üè°üíª

Welcome to the Digital Alchemy Starter Repo! 

This repository is designed to work with **Supervised** and **HA OS** based installs, where **Addons** are supported. See [installation documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/#advanced-installation-methods) for a comparison of different installation types. These instructions assume that [Studio Code Server Addon](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-vscode) has been installed, serving as both editor and workspace management tool.

## üöÄ Setup

Within the **Code Server Addon**:

1. **Open a terminal**
   - Press **Ctrl-Shift-\`** (default keybind) to open a terminal, or go through `Menu` > `Terminal` > `New Terminal`.
2. **Execute the command** ‚å®
```bash
curl -fsSL https://setup.digital-alchemy.app -o setup.sh; bash setup.sh
```
This script will:
- Install NodeJS on your system
- Clone this repository
- Install all necessary dependencies
- Add the local code runner addon as a local addon

## ‚öíÔ∏è Workspace Management

The NodeJS environment within the Code Server addon does not survive reboots, and may occasionally need to be set up again. A script has been provided to restore your environment if something goes wrong.
```bash
> ./scripts/environment.sh
```
> Also accessible as a task within VSCode as part of the workspace. Use `Tasks: Run Task` from the command palette to access

Once your environment is set up, you can use provided commands from within the `package.json` to
