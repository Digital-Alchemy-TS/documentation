## Overview

This project details the construction of Pi Matrix compatible hardware, and provides the software to do the rendering (coming soon)


> Links provided for easy to find product reference, project can be made much more cost efficiently
>
> Items marked as optional if they can be easily worked around with


> [!warning]
> This build requires some hand wiring and interacting with wires that contains high voltage. This is **not** an introductory guide,

## Matrix Contruction

The matrix is made up of 2 layers: the aluminum frame, and the rgb matrix panel.
### Frame
Diving into the frame first, this acts as the skeleton for the panel grid. Fortunately, it's pretty straight forward

### It's Alive!!!
![[party_parrot.gif]]


### Magnetic mounts

**On the frame side**
- The mount is made from a T-nut, with a standoff threaded into it through a washer.
- A magnet is screwed into the top of the standoff.

On the rgb matrix, the magnet can simply be screwed into the panel.

Keep an eye on the polarity & orientation of the magnets.
Not all magnets are polarized the same, and it is important to not have both countersunk sides on the inside (screws contact at interface).

### Attached controller

The controller can also be attached to the frame via a similar mechanism
