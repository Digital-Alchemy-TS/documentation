Digital Alchemy is a batteries included general purpose framework for building NodeJS applications within Typescript.
It is agnostic to use cases and runtimes, having no issus powering Home Automation apps, production web servers, small scripts and more!

The core framework provides all the basic tools needed to get a production grade application started including:
- configuration
- logging
- service wiring
- lifecycle & testing hooks

The project places a strong focus on code ergonomics and type safety within applications.
Services and modules are automatically assembled into a convenient api, making feature discovery within your modules a breeze!

Tools are built in an ESModule first strategy, leveraging native tooling when possible to reduce dependencies and keep your applications light weight.
