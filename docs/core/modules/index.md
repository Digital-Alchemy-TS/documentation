title: üóÉÔ∏è Modules

Modules are the basic component for organizing logic within Digital Alchemy. They contain a few basic pieces of information:

- name
- services
- configuration options
- (optional) dependencies on other modules

The most common types of modules to encounter are [application](./application) & [library](./library), with conversion to test modules possible via the [builder](./builder) tools.
