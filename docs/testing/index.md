> Everyone's frenemy - unit testing

Digital Alchemy comes with a robust set of testing utilities that can be used to test your own application.
They are used to validate internal libraries, as well as convenient hooks that can be used to test end applications.

The base testing utilities provided are provided as part of `@digital-alchemy/core`, and additional helpers are provided by downstream libraries.
