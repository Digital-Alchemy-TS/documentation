Unit tests connecting to your real instance of Home Assistant would cause all sorts of havoc.

Fortunately you are able to create fixture files and use helper libraries to change the way `hass` works to better set up the conditions for your tests.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Creating fixtures

Setting up fixtures is a 2 part process. First, we need to store all the details about your entities & registry in a file. This file will later be read from as part of the testing process instead of connecting to your real instance.

> **WARNING**: This fixtures file contains detailed information about your setup, potentially including information you do not wish to share. Take care with committing it

You can generate these types using the script.

```bash
npx mock-assistant
# or
node node_modules/@digital-alchemy/hass/dist/mock_assistant/main.js
```

The configuration file from [type-writer](/docs/home-automation/type-writer) is compatible with the script.

```bash
npx mock-assistant --config ./.type_writer
```

> ‚úÖ Outputs to `/fixtures.json` in the root of the project

The file is intended to be shared between all tests, but you can specify a different file via configuration if your needs require multiple files.

## üìù Usage in tests

### `hass`

Once the fixtures file is created, all you need to do is append `LIB_MOCK_ASSISTANT` to your test.

```typescript
testRunner.appendLibrary(LIB_MOCK_ASSISTANT)
```

This module contains all the logic to [monkey patching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) the internal `hass` library so it can use your fixtures file instead of the real socket.

Library includes tools for:

- registry interactions
  - zone
  - label
  - area
  - device
  - entity
  - floor
  - label
- configuration setup
- entity state setup & manipulation
- fake socket connection
- etc


### `synapse`
