## Overview

Welcome to `@digital-alchemy/core`!

This core library is a standard utilities library used by the other Typescript repos in the project. It is built with minimal dependencies in order to keep your production builds light and snappy. 

## üåê Core Library Overview

Code is organized into 3 types

### Project Definitions

These are created with the `CreateLibrary` / `CreateApplication` functions, and define the way that module internally relates to itself, as well as the available configurations it can consume.

For applications, the module has a `.bootstrap({ ... })` method available. Libraries are able to list other libraries as dependencies, and ultimately be imported into an end application.

### Services

- #TServiceParams

Services are attached to the project, and are defined as functions that take in a parameter typed as `TServiceParams`
